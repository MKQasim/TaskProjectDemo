1: object oriented programming approach 
= >  Implemented
2: Good UI approach e.g. MVC, etc.      
=> UI is Made By NIBs Storyboard, Custom Classes, UIColors and Theme Classes that can help fully control to modify things instantly in the app and every UI Control can convert A generic Control to use in the app when it's needed.Navigation bar is made as a custom Nib Nav Bar class with the use of generic Low level method to ntegrate it in any class with the use of Super View Controller.
3: unit test and code coverageUse 
=> Made Login Screen and dummy api call to show unit test cases with validations same procedure can be useable for other Api as well for validation and authenticate.

loginExpectations.fulfill()
waitForExpectations(timeout: 5, handler: nil)
some unit testing and code coverage is done and made class for integration testing as well.
4: code to be generic and simpleUsed 
Nib classes and Generic for Parse Api response Model send into UI different Storyboards to access viewControllers and and Nibs
5: leverage today's best coding practices
Vip Clean Swift Architecture Used the best Design Pattern for complex projects and Implement SOLID Principle. Api Networking Router is made in Native Code without using Third Party Libraries to make code more Generic usable.
clear README.md that explains 

how the code and the test can be run and how the

1:Go To Edit Scheme and click test and 
2: Check on Gather Coverage For All targets
3: Now for testing click on Show test Navigator its from left side of Xcode 6th item "Show Test Navigator"
4: with the use of the play button you can run Test cases.coverage reports can be generated by the click Show Report Navigator, it is from the left side of Xcode last item.
